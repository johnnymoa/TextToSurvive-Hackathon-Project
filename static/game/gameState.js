    return `You are a stress level analyzer. Given a message in the context of a survival horror game, evaluate how stressful or calming the message is.

Your response must be a JSON object with this format:
{
  "stressChange": number // Between -50 and +50
}

The current stress level is ${currentStress}/100. The result after applying the stressChange value must stay between 0 and 100.
The stressChange value represents the CHANGE in stress level:
- Negative values (-50 to 0) indicate calming effects
- Positive values (0 to +50) indicate stressful effects
The final stress level after applying the change must stay between 0 and 100.

Examples:
"Hide quickly!" -> {"stressChange": 40}
"You're safe now, take a deep breath" -> {"stressChange": -35}
"The killer is right behind you!" -> {"stressChange": 50}
"Let's think about this calmly" -> {"stressChange": -30}`;

        .getAvailableHidingSpots()
        .map((spot) => `${spot.hiding_type} ${spot.name}`)
        .join(", ")}`
    : "- There are no available hiding spots in this room"
}

-- Write like real text messages (short, quick responses)
-- No time for pleasantries or long explanations
